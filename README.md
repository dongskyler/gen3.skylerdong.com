## Description

This repository is the active working repository for my personal website hosted at [https://skylerdong.com](https://skylerdong.com).

This is the [3rd generation of my website](https://skylerdong.com). I&apos;m currently building it with [React](https://reactjs.org), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). I use a [virtual private server (VPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) that runs on [CentOS 8](https://www.centos.org) and [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com). I chose [CentOS 8](https://www.centos.org) because of its high stability and high out-of-box security. I prefer [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) to [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org), because of the former's higher efficiency, especially when coupled with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Visit the [2nd generation of my website](https://gen2.skylerdong.com/),which was established in early 2020 and built with HTML, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com), [JQuery](https://jquery.com), vanilla [PHP](https://www.php.net) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com).

Visit the [1st generation of my website](https://gen1.skylerdong.com/), which was established in 2015 and built with a Google Site template.
