## Description

This repository is the active working repository for my personal website at [https://skylerdong.com](https://skylerdong.com).

This is the 3rd generation of my website. I&apos;m currently building it with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com).

### Previous generations of my websites

- [2nd generation of my website](https://gen2.skylerdong.com/) and its [repository](https://github.com/dongskyler/gen2.skylerdong.com), which was established in early 2020 and built with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com), [JQuery](https://jquery.com), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), vanilla [PHP](https://www.php.net) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com).
- [1st generation of my website](https://gen1.skylerdong.com/), which was established in 2015 and built with a Google Site template.

**_Note that all websites mentioned in this README might be down, as I&apos;m currently configuring A records and the server itself._**
